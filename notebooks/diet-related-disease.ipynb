That's where visualizations become the most powerful. By visualizing our insights and predictions, we, as data scientists and data lovers, can make a real impact and educate those around us that might not have had the same opportunity to work on a project of the same subject. By visualizing our findings and those insights that have the most power to do social good, we can bring awareness and maybe even change. This journey walks you through how to do just that, with IBM's Watson Studio, Pandas, and visualization tools such as Cognos Analytics.\n\nFor this particular journey, food insecurity throughout the US is focused on. Low access, diet-related diseases, race, poverty, geography and other factors are considered by using open government data. For some context, this problem is a more and more relevant problem for the United States as obesity and diabetes rise and two out of three adult Americans are considered obese, one third of American minors are considered obsese, nearly ten percent of Americans have diabetes and nearly fifty percent of the African American population have heart disease. Even more, cardiovascular disease is the leading global cause of death, accounting for 17.3 million deaths per year, and rising. Native American populations more often than not do not have grocery stores on their reservation... and all of these trends are on the rise. The problem lies not only in low access to fresh produce, but food culture, low education on healthy eating as well as racial and income inequality.\n\nThe government data that I use in this journey has been conveniently combined into a dataset for our use, which you can find in this repo under combined_data.csv. You can find the original, government data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics https://www.bls.gov/cex/ and The United States Department of Agriculture https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/data-access-and-documentation-downloads/."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### What is Watson Studio and Cognos Analytics and why should I care enough about them to use them for my visualizations?\n\nIBM's Watson Studio, is an online browser platform where you can use notebooks or R Studio for your data science projects. Watson Studio is unique in that it automatically starts up a Spark instance for you, allowing you to work in the cloud without any extra work. Watson Studio also has open data available to you, which you can connect to your notebook. There are also other projects available, in the form of notebooks, which you can follow along with and apply to your own use case. Watson Studio also lets you save your work, share it and collaborate with others, much like I'm doing now!\n\nIBM's Watson Analytics is another browser platform which allows you to input your data, conduct analysis on it and then visualize your findings. If you're new to data science, Watson recommends connections and visualizations with the data it has been given. These visualizations range from bar and scatter plots to predictive spirals, decision trees, heatmaps, trend lines and more. The Watson platform then allows you to share your findings and visualizations with others, completing your pipeline. Check out my visualizations with the link further down in the notebook, or in the images in this repo."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Let's start with Watson Studio.\n\nHere's a tutorial on getting started with Watson Studio: https://datascience.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/creating-notebooks.html.\n\nTo summarize the introduction, you must first make an account and log in. Then, you can create a project (I titled mine: \"Diet-Related Disease\"). From there, you'll be able to add data and start a notebook. To begin, I used the combined_data.csv as my data asset. You'll want to upload it as a data asset and once that is complete, go into your notebook in the edit mode (click on the pencil icon next to your notebook on the dashboard). To load your data in your notebook, you'll click on the \"1001\" data icon in the top right. Under the \"Connections\" tab, click on \"Insert to code\" and \"pandas Data Frame\". Once you do that, a whole bunch of code will show up in your first cell. Once you see that, run the cell and follow along with my tutorial!\n\n_Quick Note: In Github you can view all of the visualizations by selecting the circle with the dash in the middle at the top right of the notebook!_"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "#import libraries\n\nfrom io import StringIO\nimport requests\nimport json\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "#### Insert your data as a Pandas DataFrame\n\n* Click on the cell below to highlight it.\n* In the upper right of this notebook, click on `01/00` to open the Data tab, then click on the `Connections` where you should see the Cognos Analytics connection you created earlier.\n* Click on `Insert to code` -> `pandas DataFrame`\n* Make sure that the data is called `df_data_1` and change it if it is not."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# @hidden_cell\n# This function accesses a file in your Cognos Analytics instance.\n", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "### Cleaning data and Exploring\n\nThis notebook starts out as a typical data science pipeline: exploring what our data looks like and cleaning the data.

We can also learn that this seems to be an inequality issue, both in income and race, with Black and Hispanic populations being more heavily impacted by food insecurity and diet-related diseases than those of the White and Asian populations. We can also see that school-aged children who qualify for reduced lunch are more likely obese than not whereas those that have a farm-to-school program are more unlikely to be obese.\n\nLike many data science investigations, this analysis could have a big impact on policy and people's approach to food insecurity in the U.S. What's best is that we can create many projects much like this in a quick time period and share them with others by using Pandas, as well as Watson's predictive and recommended visualizations.\n\nNow lets save off our refined data frame using our Cognos Analytics connection so that we can gain better insights with the visualization tools available in Cognos Analytics."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# Write data out to our Cognos Analytics connector\n# Modify path and file name to match your Cognos Analytics data set\nCADataConnector.write_data(df_focusedvalues, path=\".public_folders/_path_/_file_\")", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
